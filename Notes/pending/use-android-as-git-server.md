# Android デバイスをGit サーバーに変える方法


## How to 

1. Root your device
2. Install FTP Server app
3. Port forwarding

This can also serve as a pretty decent backup system, and if you port forward the device you're connecting to, you can even allow it access to the wider internet so that you can access your files on the go. While I wouldn't recommend it for security reasons (like seriously, just use Tailscale or WireGuard instead of port forwarding), the point is that it's a fairly robust method that can actually give you pretty decent results in a pinch for quick backups of unimportant data.
