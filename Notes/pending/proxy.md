### Shared or Private Proxies

# The differences between shared and private proxies:

Shared proxies are public proxies that can be used by anyone. This means that you’ll be sharing the same proxy IPs with other users. This means that by the time you try to use the proxies, they may already be recognized by target websites and face certain restrictions, such as:

- **Rate limit restrictions** — limiting the number of requests a given IP can send the website in a given time. This can seriously slow down web data collection.
- **CAPTCHAS** — displaying a CAPTCHA challenge that needs to be solved by a human (or a CAPTCHA solving service) which again slows down your activities.
- **GEO-location blocks** — limiting access to IPs from certain locations.
- **IP block** — completely blocking the shared IP from accessing the data on the website.
- **Misleading data** — displaying fake data for requests that come from suspicious IPs. This is a more severe restriction that can negatively affect price optimization modules and more.

Reading this might lead you to the conclusion that **shared proxies are useless**. That is not the case. They serve as an entry-level solution for simple use-cases and businesses operating on a low budget. Their benefits are:

- Offer easy scaling of **web data collection** operations.
- Pose no **bandwidth usag**e and/or target website limitations.
- Are easy to integrate with **web scrapers** and other third-party software.
