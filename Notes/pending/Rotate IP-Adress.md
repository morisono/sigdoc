# Rotate IP-Adress



## Abstract

Rotate IP-Adress in Python with ProtonVPN
With IP rotation you can enhance the level of anonymity. Additionally, it is a widely used practice to automate such tasks as data scraping and web crawling.


## Introduction



## Objectives



## Methodologies

How itâ€™s done:
We want to make use of the command-line tool from ProtonVPN, more specific we want to run the following command from the Shell in Python which which connects to a random server through VPN:
```
sudo protonvpn c -r
```
To run this command automatically from a Python program we can use the subprocess module which allows to run terminal commands. The following Python code makes a random connection to a ProtonVPN server.


Use cases:
Example 1: Random connection every hour

The following Python program connects every hour to a random VPN connection.


Example 2: Switch IP in Selenium
This example shows how you can rotate the IP-adress for a bot which is using the selenium package. The selenium package is used to automate web browser interaction from Python. The IP rotating is useful when your write a bot for a contest which you can only participate a certain amount of time with the same IP. The following pseudo-code can give you an idea:
