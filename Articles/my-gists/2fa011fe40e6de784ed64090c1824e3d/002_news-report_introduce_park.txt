Spring has arrived in Japan, and it's the perfect time to enjoy cherry blossom viewing. Today,
I'm at Yono Park, one of the most famous parks in Japan, and I want to introduce its features to you.

One of the main attractions of this park is the Flower Festival, which takes place every year in late March.
Visitors can enjoy the stunning beauty of the cherry blossoms in full bloom during this time. In addition to the festival,
there's a rose festival held in July, which features open-air shops and adds another layer of beauty to the park.

Yono Park is roughly divided into three areas, the largest of which is the flower garden on the west side.
This area is quite spacious and well-maintained.
Adjacent to the flower garden is a tennis court and baseball field, which are popular among sports enthusiasts.

Playground equipment is installed throughout the park,
making it a great place for children to have fun.
On holidays and weekends, the park is bustling with families and pet owners taking a stroll or enjoying a picnic.

As I stroll through the park, I come across a small pond, where visitors can observe nishiki-goi.
These fish are highly prized and sometimes can be traded for around $100-200 each at aquarium dealers shop.
The pond is also home to turtles and other aquatic creatures. In fact, I just saw a turtle sitting motionless on a stone nearby.
At first, I thought it was a statue, but as I approach, I realize that it's a real turtle basking in the sun.

Moving on, I come across a fountain with a simple but tasteful design.
Its aesthetics remind me of the ancient Japanese Zen philosophy, which emphasizes simplicity and tranquility.
It's a beautiful piece that adds to the overall ambiance of the park.

Another unique feature of this park is that there is a small shrine on the premises, adding to the spiritual atmosphere.
Its stunning natural beauty, diverse range of activities, and tranquil atmosphere make it a great place to spend a day with family and friends.
If you're planning a trip to Japan, why don't you add this park to your list of must-visit destinations?
