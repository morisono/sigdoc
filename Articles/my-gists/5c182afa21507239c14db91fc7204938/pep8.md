    # "name", "author", "version", and "description" are required entries
    # "dependencies" is required if the module requires the installation of a third party library (list of PyPI install names)
    # "files" is required if the module includes a reference to a data file in the "/data" folder of the marketplace repository
    # "required_keys" is required if the module leverages an API or builtin functionality that requires a key
    # "query" is optional and determines the "default" source of input
    # the "SOURCE" option is only available if "query" is defined
    # "options" expects a tuple of tuples containing 4 elements:
    # 1. the name of the option
    # 2. the default value of the option (strings, integers and boolean values are allowed)
    # 3. a boolean value (True or False) for whether or not the option is mandatory
    # 4. a description of the option
