Learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its various concepts and principles can be approached through a combination of books and online resources. Here are some of the most effective resources, each covering different aspects of OOP:

### Books
1. **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides**:
   - This classic book, often referred to as the "Gang of Four" book, is essential for understanding design patterns and principles in OOP. It covers strategies, policies, and various patterns that can be applied to software design.
