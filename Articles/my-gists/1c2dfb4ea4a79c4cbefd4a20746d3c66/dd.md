Sure, here are the batch scripts to perform the required tasks:

### Escalate Execution Policy
```batch
@echo off
REM Escalate execution policy to allow running scripts
PowerShell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser"
```

### Change Network Setting to Open Port (Port Forwarding)
```batch
@echo off
REM Open a specific port for port forwarding
setlocal
set port=8080
set ipaddress=192.168.1.10

REM Add inbound rule to open the port
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port %port%" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=%port% action=allow

REM Enable port forwarding
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=%port% listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=%port% connectaddress=%ipaddress%
endlocal
```

### Make it Detectable by Crawlers like Censys, Shodan, etc.
```batch
@echo off
REM Make the service detectable by setting up a simple HTTP server with identifiable information

REM Start a Python HTTP server to serve a web page with identifiable information
echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to My Test Server</h1><p>This server is detectable by crawlers like Shodan and Censys.</p></body></html>" > index.html
python -m http.server %port%
```

Save these scripts as `.bat` files and run them with administrative privileges. This will escalate the execution policy, set up port forwarding, and make the server detectable by web crawlers.
