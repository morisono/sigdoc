### LockBit 3.0 Configuration Diagram
LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, incorporates a range of sophisticated techniques to ensure it runs effectively on the target systems while avoiding detection. The configuration diagram typically includes:

1. **Initialization and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Checks for existing privileges and attempts to elevate them.
   - If necessary privileges are not found, it attempts to duplicate tokens from processes like `explorer.exe`.

2. **Mutex Creation**:
   - Creates a unique mutex to ensure only one instance runs at a time, based on the MD5 hash of the public key.

3. **Service Disruption**:
   - Stops and deletes various security services such as Windows Defender using the Trusted Installer service's access token.

4. **Multi-threading for Task Execution**:
   - Multiple threads are launched for different tasks such as encrypting files, stopping services, and managing files in the Recycle Bin【25】【27】.

### Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram for LockBit 3.0 would typically illustrate the process flow from initial infection to the ransom demand:

1. **Initial Infection**:
   - Exploitation of vulnerabilities or use of phishing emails to deliver the initial payload.

2. **Establish Persistence**:
   - The malware ensures it starts on reboot and remains undetected by disabling security services.

3. **Encryption of Files**:
   - Encrypts local and network files while ensuring the victim cannot recover them without the decryption key.

4. **Ransom Note Deployment**:
   - Drops a ransom note in each directory and changes the desktop wallpaper to inform the victim of the attack.

5. **Data Exfiltration and Leak Threat**:
   - Exfiltrates sensitive data and threatens to publish it on a leak site if the ransom is not paid【26】【29】.
